# bClick
The b-Click-ing game!
## Overview
Unlock B's by purchasing them with points. Then click the B image to get points.
Unlock the next B to get more points than the previous one.

Is that a lot of work for you? How about depositing points in the bank to get points from interest!
Get trillions, and maybe even septillions of points a second!
## Features
- Many B's for you to click
- A bank to give points every few seconds
- Achievements to give boosts
- Live online leaderboards
