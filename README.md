# Information

This is The bClick Team code repository. I (Cameron Samuels) will make changes to the code and commit & push them into this repo for people to see the code. when I push the code, it also uploads to the [website](https://playbclick.com) for everyone to use. So this is all the code on The bClick Team's website.

## What you will use BitBucket for

You can go to the Issues tab for submit issues (ideas, bugs, suggestions, etc) for us to view and make changes to the code to fit those needs.
So, submit all your ideas in the Issues tab. We will never get overwhelmed with these suggestions.
