# Information

This is The bClick Team code repository. I (Cameron Samuels) will make changes to the code and commit & push them into this repo for people to see the code. when I push the code, it also uploads to the [website](https://playbclick.com) for everyone to use. So this is all the code on The bClick Team's website.

## What you will use BitBucket for

You can go to the Issues tab for submit issues (ideas, bugs, suggestions, etc) for us to view and make changes to the code to fit those needs.
So, submit all your ideas in the Issues tab. We will never get overwhelmed with these suggestions.

# Get setup

* Click the watch (eye) button on the top right of the overview tab to be a part of us
* Wait for us to give you a @playbclick email for use for business if you are working for us. This will allow you to be able to contact us and sign up for the apps we use for business with that email address.
* After that, wait for a slack account to be created for you. This will let you contact us and cooperate with business related stuff in private or group chats with the members of our company.
