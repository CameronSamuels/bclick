### 1c. **How do we use your information?**
We may use the information we collect from you when you provide it to personalize your experience and to allow us to publish the information to the public when they ask to see it. Because a username is not very personal, this doesn't harm the user, and even if it was personal, the user should not have chose to provide the information.
### 1d. **How do we protect your information?**
Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of people who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep things such as login information confidential.
