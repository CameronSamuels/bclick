# The bClick Privacy Policy
### 1a. What information do we collect from the people that visit the bClick website or app?
When using the bClick website or app, you will never be asked to enter any information of any sort.
### 1b. Why don't we collect information?
Unlike many other websites or apps, you don't have an account or a profile in bClick. The information on your device is only visible on that one device. bClick does not have an account or profile system to publicize people's information like scores or stats because bClick is a singleplayer game with no online interaction.
### 2. Do we use 'cookies'?
We do not use cookies for anything bClick related. The only cookies used are third party cookies including our domain service provider (only applies for the website version), and analytic tracking.
### 3a. Third-party disclosure
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information.
### 3b. Third-party links
Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our website. These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.
### 3c. Advertisements
We do not include any form of advertising in our apps or websites, but we may do so in the future.
### 3d. Analytics
We use Google Analytics for bClick to track how many page views we receive. We do not track information such as age, gender, and race.
